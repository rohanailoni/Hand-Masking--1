# Hand Masking Using OpenCv

When ever we heard of hand detection we all get to know about Tensorflow or mediapipe pretrained models but actully how really a hand detection works.this code is about detecting hand using thresholding,bitmasking,countur detection,Using convex hull algorithm,Finding convexvity defects for finding space between two Fingers

This was breifly discussed in the medium article 

## Environment Variables

To run this code, you will need to add the following environment variables installed

`Python 3`
